                    <!-- You can write your explanation here -->
                    This chapter is the most fundamental in all of physics. Furthermore, I believe that this chapter is also the most visible chapter in our day to day life. 
                    I mean, who hasn't seen a car moving and a bucket at rest?
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Since this is the very first chapter of class 9 physics(which is anyway considered to be a big leap), we attempt to explain concepts in a different manner than the conventional way. Some concepts might be unprecedented for the students, but if learnt carefully, they can be confident of solving any question or numerical arising from this chapter. We keep some preliminaries as follows(dont worry if you dont have any idea about them, we try to cover those as well in this page. Although, these help to grasp concepts better).
                </p>
                <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Basic graphs (about two-dimensional coordinates)</li>
                    <li>Slope and inclination</li>
                    <li>Basic motion theory (as in Class 6)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In this explanation, we will cover the first two prerequisites, but not the third one since it has already been covered in class 6(for a revision you can quickly skim through the class 6 motion chapter from ncert book class 6 science).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Basic graphs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Till now, we have considered physics to be an independent subject, with laws and rules that are used to solve problems and relate to the real world in some form or the other. However now, we realize that physics is not independent, but <em>"INTERDEPENDENT"</em> on other realms of study. In particular, mathematics, which is universally recognized as the language of the universe, is the primary tool of all the physicists and physics students across the world, since it helps us to solve problems which require mathematical insight(for instance, this chapter). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the core things we have been doing till now in mathematics is <em>"statistics"</em>. This is a widely useful topic, however considered to be immensely boring by the students of middle school since they do not see a direct use of this. In this sub-topic, we attempt to use our previous knowledge of statistics and data handling to learn about an immensely powerful tool - coordinate geometry. Do not be afraid, this is not something related to rocket science, in fact we have already done this before. You don't believe me, well then watch:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The table below shows how runs scored in multiple matches are grouped into class intervals. This data can be easily plotted as a histogram.

                <p>
                    Now let me tell you that this is a direct application of coordiante geometry, and you have always been using it without knowing! Well this is unfair, so let me make it fair and teach you about this tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coordinate geometry is nothing but the graphical representation of math. It involves plotting data so that it can studied and analyzed easily. It basically consists of two axes - X and Y, where X extends to the right direction and Y extends to the upward direction. The begin from a point which we call the origin, which is basically a point from which distances are measured(all this will make sense in a minute, hang on). Below is how this looks like.
                </p>
                <canvas id="coordinatePlane" width="500" height="500" style="border:1px solid #ccc; margin-top: 40px;"></canvas>
                <p>
                    As you can see in the above picture, there are two lines, one is horizontal and another is vertical. As mentioned earlier, X axis is the horizontal axis and Y axis is the vertical axis. There is a point marked O, which is known as the <em>"origin"</em>. It is the point of intersection of the axes(plural of axis), and is the point from which we measure distances on this plane. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By distances, what I mean is that we can measure the seperation between two things using this. As you can see in the above picture, we have points marked at unit distances from each other. As in the x axis, we have on the right side the point 1 marked 1 unit to the right of the origin, and 2 marked 2 unit to the right of origin and 1 unit to the right of point 1. Similar case happens in the upward direction for the Y axis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is this deal with the negative numbers on the plane? These numbers follow the same concept of unit distances from each other, these are just used to represent the directions opposite to the conventional axis direction. For instance, the negative numbers of the left of the X axis(see above) can be seen to be used to represent distances in a direction opposite to the conventional X axis direction(right), which is left. Similarly, negative numbers on the y axis point in the downward direction instead of up. This is basically the <em>"negative"</em> direction of the axis, and we will get to know their utility soon too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the way, we are also going to learn about <em>"DIMENSIONS"</em> through this, which till now might have seemed to be some marvel sci-fi, tech related stuff, but trust me, it is as simple as addition is in arithmetic. But for that, you would have to wait a little.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you might ask, "well now I get it that this thing exists, but you have been telling about measuring distances. How to do that?". Well for that, take a moment to view the picture below and try to understand its meaning before moving to its explanation.
                </p>
                <canvas id="pointPlane" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-top: 30px;"></canvas>
                <p>Notice the red dots? Those are what we call <em>the points on the coordinate plane</em>, which basically is a pair of two numbers, the first one being the distance of the point from the origin in the X-direction(to the right if positive and left if negative), and the second one being the distance of the point from the origin in the Y-direction(up if positive, down if negative).</p>
                <p>
                    For instance, take the point (2, 3) plotted above. If you notice carefully, it is 2 units to the right of the origin(in the X direction) and 3 units upwards(in the Y direction). Similarly, the point (-2, -3) is 2 units to the left and 3 units to the bottom of the origin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you might ask, well then what is the need of all this? Well, let me give you something. Let us take an equation: <strong>y = 2x + 3.</strong> By substituting some values of x, we can easily get some values of y as follows:

                      <tr>

                        <td style="padding: 10px;">7</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr style="background-color: #f0f9ff;">
                        <td style="padding: 10px;">3</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px;">9</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 10px;">4</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px;">11</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr style="background-color: #f0f9ff;">

                        <td style="padding: 10px;">13</td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                <p>
                    Now, what we can do is we can plot(or basically mark) these x and y values as corresponding points on this plane and connect them with a line through these points creating a straight line as follows: 
                </p>                  
                <canvas id="lineGraph" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; display: block; margin: 40px auto;"></canvas>
                <p>
                    How does this help me? Well now, I know how the equation looks like and instead of always putting in the x values to obtain the y values, i can take any point on this line and the corresponding y values can be recorded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind: <strong>All the points on this line would follow the rules of the line(equation). So, all the points on the line would have their y = 2x + 3.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well now, let me fulfill my promise. Or wait, should I keep it for later. Maybe yes, I will maintain my promise to teach you about dimensions and make you marvel equipped, but some suspense is necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>Calm down warrior</h2>
                <p>
                    You have just learned a whole new set of information. You might even begin to blame me for adding this in, as you cannot see any theory related to this in your ncert books. However, as I told you earlier, this approach of learning about motion is going to be different than the conventional approach. Thus, it is highly recommended that if you still arent 100% confident about this theory, take a break, and read again. Watch some youtube tutorials if needed. But you must maintain the calm and learning mindset, otherwise it is going to be a mess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember: <strong>This theory is going to make each and every person grasp the ins and outs of motion, and if someone devotes the time required to learn all this, it is guaranteed that he/she would not lose a single mark on any tests or exams related to this chapter. This is for those who are struggling to understand, but also for those who want to become better at this. It is the bridge between good to great, and that is why it is tough.</strong>
                </p>
                <h2>Slope of a line</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been to a hilly area for a vacation, or is it that you live in a hilly area. If yes, then you might have often heard of the word <em>slope</em>. Someone might have said that: "the hill has high slope, we should not be climbing this". But what is this slope, and why are we even learning geography in physics???
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relax, it is not geography. You should be asking, why are we including math in geography? Yes, this term is related to and originates from mathematics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slope is the <em>inclination</em> of a line. It represents how tilted a line is. Let me elaborate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us take the previous line <strong>y = 2x + 3</strong> which we plotted earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take any two points on this line. Let us say we take any random two from the table we had, say we take (1, 5) and (2, 7). Now the slope of this line is essentially the <em>ratio of the differnces of y coordinates and x coordinates.</em> Mathematically:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <p>$$\text{Slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    where y<sub>2</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> are the y coordinates of the two points chosen, and x<sub>2</sub> and x<sub>1</sub> are the x coordinates of the two points chosen.
